      <h3>
        Frida Kahlo, full name Magdalena Carmen Frieda Kahlo y Calderón (born
        July 6, 1907, Coyoacán, Mexico—died July 13, 1954, Coyoacán), Mexican
        painter best known for her uncompromising and vividly colored
        self-portraits that deal with subjects such as identity, the human body,
        and death. Despite her denial, she is frequently recognized as a
        Surrealist. Aside from her art, Kahlo was well-known for her turbulent
        relationship with muralist Diego Rivera (married 1929, divorced 1939,
        remarried 1940).
      </h3>
      <h3>
        Kahlo was born in Mexico City to a German father of Hungarian ancestry
        and a Mexican mother of Spanish and Native American ancestry. Throughout
        her creative career, Kahlo usually depicted her ancestors as binary
        opposites: the colonial European side and the indigenous Mexican side.
        She had polio as a youngster, which left her with a minor limp, a
        chronic disease she would have to live with for the rest of her life.
        Her father, a skilled photographer, was especially close to Kahlo, and
        she regularly accompanied him in his studio, where she developed a keen
        eye for detail. Although she attended some sketching lessons, Kahlo was
        primarily interested in science, and in 1922 she enrolled in Mexico
        City's National Preparatory School with the intention of eventually
        studying medicine. She met Rivera when she was there, who was working on
        a mural for the school's auditorium.
